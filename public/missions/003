# Mission // #003
## Long, Lonesome Road

The Office of Interstellar Transportation put out a bounty for the construction of these stations for the sake of expanding the reach of metropolitan space,
as well as opening shipping lanes. In this deal, IPS-N is handsomely paid up-front for the construction of the station, and retains a small revenue cut from
all traffic going through the station while having toll-free access, themselves.

To this end, the IPS-N Cook, a Northstar fleet carrier, has been retrofitted for the herculean task of on-site manufacture of blink stations. While lacking the 
vast numbers of fighter craft that it would usually carry, the Cook is still heavily armed, and the crew - numbering in the thousands - are seasoned staff.

OSS has been brought on as an outside element that has proven itself in recent times to be a valuable asset in the Ural Line.

# Goals
- Oversee the construction of blinkgates
- Ensure the safety of the station
- Enforce IPS-N following the utopian pillars and the law.
- Act as an outside element to de-escalate personnel issues even-handedly.

# Stakes
- If civil unrest boils over, the mission cannot be completed due to failing to lack of worker morale and willing personnel.
- If the IPS-N Cook's security is compromised, it could mean the deaths of hundreds, if not thousands aboard it.

# Reserves
- WIP

# Mission // #002
## Kaiju Hunt

Smith-Shimano Corpro has put out a bounty for genetic material from a one-of-a-kind species on Sparr, and OSS happened to the first to claim it. Using genetic material from this unique beast, SSC would be able to
mass-produce biological materials from it, and perhaps harvest some of its more marketable qualities. The trouble is that the beast has been wrecking local clan's settlements and causing tensions to flare.

# Goals
- Acquire genetic samples from the Kaiju on Sparr
- Avoid disrupting the ecology or political situation of Sparr any further than strictly necessary.

# Stakes
- If the mission is failed, the beast likely roams free to cause more damage, and the situation on Sparr worsens - not to mention that SSC loses its golden opportunity.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
